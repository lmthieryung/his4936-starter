## Medici use of Ancient Roman Standards and how it influenced the Florentine Citizen

The precedent for patronage structures within a republic such as Florence came from Rome.  Vitruvius made the distinction between the public and private space within the ancient Roman home or domus evident in his first century de Architectura (15-13 BCE).  He defined the private spaces of the home as “belonging to the family,” and the public spaces are those “shared with visitors.”  Vitruvius's approach to privacy is particularly important to consider because his definition also integrates the status of the visitor in relation to the owner of the residence in order to determine the degree of access.

Those of a higher social status than the owner were allowed into those rooms of the family, earning the title of invited guests. Meanwhile, uninvited guests were allowed only within the public spaces. This distinction between invited and uninvited guests seems to correlate more closely with the observed social structures of the Renaissance palazzo.  Even the layout of the Palazzo Medici seems to have drawn inspiration from Roman models.  Like the ancient Roman domus, the Palazzo was an intentional space.  Rooms were set along a linear passageway, with straight walls and ninety-degree angles. While this seems unsurprising today, the labyrinth effect of earlier Italian palaces, such as the Palazzo della Signoria, stood in marked contrast to this arrangement.  The Palazzo Medici was built around an open square courtyard. The courtyard allowed access to all the other areas of the Palazzo.  The most recognizable feature of the Roman domus was the central atrium.  It was the space in which the client would call upon his patron to inquire if there was anything he could do for the patron that day. This ritual, the salutatio, was crucial to the functioning of the later Republic and early Empire and dictated the plan of the ground floor of Roman residences during that time.   The Palazzo Medici's use of the same architectural framework likely stems from the similarity in social functioning between the ancient Romans and the contemporary republican Florentines.  

Though contemporaries of Cosimo saw in the residence the strains of ancient influence, the Palazzo’s strongest similarity to ancient Roman domus is not to be found in the magnificence of the structure, rather, it is in the functioning of the space.  As John R. Clarke states that, “... the Roman house was in no way private.  It was the locus of the owner's social, political, and business activities, open both to invited and uninvited visitors.”
