# Source Analysis

The main source for the data table created for this project comes from the ARTstor Database.  

During the late 1990s, institutions of higher education — particularly image-intensive fields like art history — were beginning to struggle with how to migrate from analog slides to digital images. Efforts like the digital library JSTOR were already underway to convert print-base journal collections to electronic ones, enabling colleges and universities to expand access while sharing costs for technology and preservation. For images, a similar effort had similar potential to lower institutional costs and increase access, in addition to addressing a lack of standards and daunting intellectual property concerns.  In response to the community's needs, and after countless requests from universities to invest in local solutions to digitize images from their slide collections – Andrew W. Mellon Foundation president, William G. Bowen, asked two trusted staff members, James Shulman and Gretchen Wagner, to lead a new effort focused on how digitization and use of images could support teaching and research in the arts and humanities at scale. The initiative was named Artstor. (“Mission & History | Artstor.” Accessed March 2, 2017. http://www.artstor.org/mission.)



# What is ARTstor

ARTStor is a collaborative, subscription based collection of art from around the globe.  It contains photographs and information about the holdings of most major museums and institutions.  This collaborative effort has given us access to most of the great artwork of human history.  It is set you as a searchable database.  A user may chose artists, time period, medium, place, or any number of other distinguishing factors when searching the data provided by this highly reputable and academic database.



# How to Access ARTstor

Since ARTstor is a subscription based service, one must subscribe or use you institutions subscription to access the data.  For USF students access is located at:  http://library.artstor.org.ezproxy.lib.usf.edu/library/#1



# Information Obtained

The information in the ARTstor database is collected and maintained by an initiative of like minded academics who wished to provide a central clearing house for artwork without any apparent bias or motives.

# Success of this Effort

ARTstor is a very reputable, scholarly source of accurate information.  Unfortunately, the site is using antiquated I-frame modules that are not conducive to easy data collection.  It will therefore be necessary to manually gather the information provided by the site.  This process will include approximately 430 different works of art, each with 10-15 fields of information.
